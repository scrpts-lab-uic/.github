# welcome
Welcome to the SCRPTS Lab GitHub

The goal of the <b>Systems-based Collaborative Research for PatienT Safety Lab</b> (SCRPTS Lab, pronounced scripts) is to markedly improve patient safety through a systems-based, human factors approach and by partnering with multidisciplinary researchers, scientists, practitioners, and community stakeholders to develop and study interventions that improve care.

We achieve our goal through two main research portfolios: 1) Community Pharmacy Work Systems and 2) Medication Information Communication Across Disparate Teams. Weâ€™ve also done work regarding pharmacy workforce utilization, student well-being and training, and broader health outcomes commentary.
